# This file: scaler.map
# Author: Robert Michaels, Jlab
# Contains time-dependent text-based mapping of Hall A scaler channels
# which permits getting data from THaScaler by names like "bcm_u3".
# Also contains "directives" that control xscaler and simplify
# the map, e.g. tying helicity scaler map to non-helicity scaler 
# For documentation about this file, see
# http://hallaweb.jlab.org/equipment/daq/THaScaler.html (scroll to "scaler.map"
# near the end of that web page).
